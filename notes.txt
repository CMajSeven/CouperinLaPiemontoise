In the original score, accidentals apply to repetitions of a note even across barlines. I add accidentals across a barline.]
Beaming regularized

I
----------------------
I-12: Second half note missing stem in part
VI-18: Too many beams on 32nd notes
VII-35: Dot and beam seem to be crossed out to match II.
VIII-18: Has quarter instead of eighth note.

II
----------------------
I-5: To match other parts, should have breath mark.
IV-13: Should probably have breath mark.
23: ~~Should probably have breath mark.~~
31: ~~Should probably have breath mark.~~
VI-2: Maybe should have breath mark? Consistently doesn't have breath mark at 18 and 26.
18: Should probably have breath mark. TODO put in brackets
VIII-2: Triplets have one too many beams.
VIII-18: Has quarter instead of eighth note.

Bowed bass
---------------------
IV-31: Tr√®s lentement, other parts just have lentement
VI-3: There is a straight line between the G and F#. It is difficult to tell what this is. Slur or error? Figured bass has what looks like a hold line in the same place.
VIII-7: 32nd notes have one too many beams.
13: ~~Should probably have breath mark.~~

Figured bass
----------------------
IV-8: Should probably have breath mark.
V-25-: Should maybe have figures from beginning.
29: Maybe should be 64, not 65 to match dessus parts.
VI-1: This is the only part that says "fort".
VIII-15: Need to remove 5 in post. (12 glyph replaced with empty, 14 replaced with 7)
